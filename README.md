# CS201 Introduction to Computing
* The objective of this course is to introduce students to the field of computing and problem solving with the help of an object-oriented programming language (C++). Hence the course will cover many C++ features in detail as needed so students will also be learning a structured programming language.

* Through the lectures, quizzes, take-home exams, and interactive recitations students will learn how to design algorithms based on object-oriented programming paradigms.
